# [My personal website](http://brianhendrick.com/)

Personal website seem somewhat obsolete with the amount of digital platforms we can project our egos and portray ourselves. That being said, as someone who works in digital I find having a personal website as online real-estate that is essential for showing my online presence and being tech savvy. It is also really fun to build and learn how to develop for the web.

There are plenty of platforms which easily let you create websites, but these can be costly and limiting. So I decided to create this website completely in a web-browser, using an open source template and hosting on github. The only cost of maintaining this website is my time and the price of a domain name.

Fun fact, my indecisiveness made me purchase two domain names: brianhendrick.com and hendrick.digital, I decided to go with the former but may spontaneously switch to the latter because I think it sounds cooler.
